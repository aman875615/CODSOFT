💻 CodSoft C++ Internship Projects
Welcome to the C++ Internship project repository for CodSoft. This repo includes simple console-based projects created during the internship to strengthen basic programming concepts and logic-building in C++.

📌 TASK 1: Number Guessing Game 🎯
Description:
A simple number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, feedback is given to indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Features:
Random number generation
User input for guesses
Feedback on each guess
Loop continues until correct guess
📌 TASK 2: Simple Calculator ➕➖✖️➗
Description:
A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:
Input: Two numbers and the desired operation
Operations: +, -, *, /
Displays the result based on selected operation
📌 TASK 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game ❌⭕️
Description:
A two-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using a 3x3 grid.

Features:
Game Board: 3x3 grid
Players: "X" and "O"
Turn-based input
Win and Draw detection
Game restart option
Game Logic Includes:
Display Board
Player Input
Update Board
Check for Win
Check for Draw
Switch Players
Display Result
Play Again
📌 TASK 4: To-Do List ✅📝
Description:
A console-based to-do list manager allowing users to add, view, mark, and remove tasks.

Features:
Add Task: Add a new task to the list
View Tasks: Display all tasks with their completion status
Mark Completed: Update a task as completed
Remove Task: Delete a task from the list
🛠 Tech Stack:
Language: C++
IDE: VS Code / Code::Blocks / Dev C++
Platform: Console-based applications
📚 Learning Outcomes:
Improved understanding of C++ syntax and structure
Implemented real-world logic through basic projects
Practiced using loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures
🏁 Conclusion:
These tasks helped solidify the foundational programming concepts in C++. Each task gradually increased in complexity, ensuring hands-on learning throughout the internship.
